This directory contains the binder and a stub downloader that simply mmaps the 
mobile blocks from the disk (it is only present for testing purposes).

To generate the Makefile for the binder object that will be linked in, run the 
generate.sh script. This script takes three arguments: the path to the compiler 
in the patched toolchain, the name for the binder object and the name for the 
downloader object.

Example: 
./generate.sh ~/diablo/toolchain-gcc-4.8.1-arm/bin/arm-diablo-linux-gnueabi-cc binder.o downloader.o

Two pre-generated Makefiles for ARM Linux and Android targets are provided.
