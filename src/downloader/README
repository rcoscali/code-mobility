This directory contains the downloader that obtains code blocks via the ACCL.

To generate the Makefile for the binder object that will be linked in, run the 
generate.sh script. This script takes two arguments: the path to the compiler 
in the patched toolchain the target platform: android (ARM), linux (ARM).

Example: ./generate.sh /opt/diablo-gcc-toolchain/bin/arm-diablo-linux-gnueabi-gcc linux

Two pre-generated Makefiles for ARM Linux and Android targets are provided.
